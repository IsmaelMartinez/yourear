1. Create file: `docs/adr/NNN-title.md`
2. Use template:
   ```markdown
   # ADR NNN: Title
   
   ## Status
   Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded
   
   ## Context
   What is the issue?
   
   ## Decision
   What was decided?
   
   ## Consequences
   What are the results?
   ```

### New Research Document
1. Create file in `docs/research/`
2. Include: Overview, Analysis, Recommendations, References
